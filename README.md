# CheatEngine-Pointers

The Other Challenges were quite easy because they are the same concept of scanning the value in memory and applying changes.


But the challenge is how to deal with a programme or a game that is constantly changing the adresse upon runtime

That when cheat engine offers Pointer Scanning

Which is the concept of finding the pointer that holds the adress of the value we want to find so that even if the adress is changed 

the pointer finds it back
